  abort <<~MESSAGE
    This engine's Gemfile cannot boot PlaceCal core, so `rake spec` cannot work.
    Run the specs against core's bundle instead:

      PLACECAL_CORE_PATH=/path/to/PlaceCal \\
        BUNDLE_GEMFILE=/path/to/PlaceCal/Gemfile.td-dev \\
        RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec

    See "Development" in README.md.
